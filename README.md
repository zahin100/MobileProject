# About My Diary: Mobile Application

My Diary is a mobile application that allows users to keep a personal diary of their thoughts, memories, and experiences. The app is designed to be user-friendly, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to add, edit, and view their notes. 

The app's main feature is the ability to add notes, which includes a day, date, and time of the note written. Users can access the notes from the home page, where they are displayed in a chronological order. Each note can be edited or deleted by the user. The notes are stored in a remote database, which is built using XAMPP and MySQL. The database uses three tables to store the user's data: customer, customer_profile, and notes.

The app also includes a Profile section where users can view and edit their personal information. The information includes the user's first name, last name, phone number, birthdate, email address, and gender. The information is also stored in the database and can be accessed by the user at any time.

The app also includes a new page called Today's Activity, which provides suggestions for activities that users can do on that day. The suggestions are generated by using an external REST API from https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity, which returns a list of activities that include the name of the activity, type, number of participants, and price.

The app also includes a Camera Activity, where users can capture and view images. The app also has a calendar page where users can view the calendar, and a Maps page which utilizes the Google Maps API to display a marker for Technical University of Malaysia, Melaka.

The app also has a login and registration feature for user convenience, it uses the information stored in the customer table of the database. The app's design allows users to easily navigate through the different features and access their notes, personal information, and images with ease, as well as today's activity suggestions.

## Database Used

The mobile application My Diary uses a remote relational database to store the user's data. A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables with rows and columns, and uses relationships between the tables to link the data together. This type of database is well suited for the app's needs as it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of the user's notes, personal information, and activity suggestions.

The database is built using XAMPP, which utilizes the MySQL database management system. MySQL is a widely used, open-source relational database management system that is known for its reliability, robustness, and ease of use.

The app uses three tables in the database to store different types of information. 


The first table is called "customer" and it includes the following fields:
* username: a unique identifier for the user
* password: the hashed password for the user's account
* email: the email address associated with the user's accountâ€¨

The second table is called "customer_profile" and it includes the following fields:
* username: a foreign key linking to the corresponding user in the "customer" table
* first_name: the user's first name
* last_name: the user's last name
* phone_number: the user's phone number
* birth_date: the user's birthdate
* email_address: the user's email address
* gender: the user's gender

The third table is called "notes" and it includes the following fields:
* username: a foreign key linking to the corresponding user in the "customer" table
* note: the text of the note that the user has written
* date: the day, date, and time that the note was written



The database is designed to keep the user's data separate and organized, with each table having a specific purpose, such as storing the user's login information, personal information, and notes. The foreign key linking the tables together allows the app to retrieve and display the appropriate information for each user.
